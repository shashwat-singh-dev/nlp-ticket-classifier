# 🧠 NLP Ticket Classifier

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer support systems receive a large number of queries daily. Manually categorizing these tickets into appropriate departments (Billing, Technical, Security, etc.) is time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal of this project is to build an automated NLP-based system that can classify support tickets into predefined categories and assign priority levels.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Classifies support tickets into:
  - Billing
  - Technical
  - Login Issue
  - Security
  - Delivery
  - Query
- Priority prediction (High / Medium / Low)
- FastAPI backend for real-time predictions
- Streamlit frontend for interactive UI
- End-to-end ML pipeline implementation

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Understood how text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Learned how machine learning models handle text classification problems
- Gained experience in building an end-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → API → UI)
- Understood the importance of data quality and balanced datasets
- Learned how keyword patterns affect model predictions
- Integrated backend (FastAPI) with frontend (Streamlit)
- Learned how to deploy and structure ML projects professionally
---
## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Small dataset caused inaccurate predictions initially  
- Model was biased towards certain categories (like Billing)  
- Similar categories (e.g., Technical vs Query) were confusing for the model  
- Difficulty in improving model accuracy with limited data  
- Managing consistency between training and prediction preprocessing  
- Integrating FastAPI backend with Streamlit frontend
---
## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Improve model accuracy using a larger and more diverse dataset  
- Try advanced models such as Random Forest or transformer-based models (BERT)  
- Add proper evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)  
- Replace rule-based priority system with a machine learning-based approach  
- Deploy the full system (FastAPI + Streamlit) on cloud platforms  
- Improve UI/UX for better user experience
